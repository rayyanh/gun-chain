# gun-chain
A full application that utilizes the blockchain to track firearm related transactional information.

For this project, we created a JS based blockchain from scratch using the SHA256 algorithm. Included features are randomized hashes, added mining difficulties, tamper proof methods, and more. 

The front end utilizes React.js to create UI. JSON formatted strings are presented out to user. The UI also features the ability to view the blockchain and add to the blockchain as well.
